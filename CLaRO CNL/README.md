The files in this directory are the actual templates, presented as simple csv file and in XML including its schema. 

It also contains the file to trace back how the templates came about, from the original CQs linked to Wesniewski et al's CQ patterns, and from there to the ClaRO templates (with some design decisions as to what was merged and renumbered)
